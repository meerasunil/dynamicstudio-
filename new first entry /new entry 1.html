<h1>HARMONIC COLLECTION: <br>WEEKEND DIARY <br>sept22-jan23</h1>
<div id="centerbox">Originally, my harmonic collection was going to be a 12-week exploration into the act of "going-out" on the weekends.<br><br> However, as the semester went on my weekends became a lot calmer, and my weekends became a lot less centered on the nighttime. <br><br> Therefore, this harmonic collection of digital entries has become a "weekend blog" of sorts.   </div>
